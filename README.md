## How I started to project?

*My first step in project design was to research the desired steps one by one. Then I integrated the technologies and libraries I wanted to use in my project. Finally, I ran my project live with firebase.* 

## How to run project ?

*In this step, I start a local server and run the project in my browser. To start my React project, I run npm start.*

```
npm start
````

*The development server starts at localhost:3000.*
